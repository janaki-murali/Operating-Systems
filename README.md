# Operating Systems - C Code Examples

Welcome to the **Operating Systems - C Code Examples** repository! This repository contains a collection of C programs designed to demonstrate various concepts and algorithms related to operating systems. It includes examples for process scheduling, memory management, disk scheduling, semaphores, and more.

## Programs Included

This repository includes the following C programs:

### 1. **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**
   - Demonstrates inter-process communication using different techniques like pipes, shared memory, or message queues.
   - File: `IPC/User1.c` and `IPC/User2.c`

### 2. **Banker's Algorithm**
   - Implements the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance in resource allocation.
   - File: `Banker's_Algorithm.c`

### 3. **Disk Scheduling**
   - Simulates disk scheduling using different algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, or SCAN.
   - File: `Disk_Scheduling.c`

### 4. **FCFS CPU Scheduling**
   - Implements First Come First Serve (FCFS) CPU scheduling algorithm.
